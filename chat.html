<h2>rules<h2>

<p>Before I even get started on this document, or you even begin reading it, understand I write it with the understanding that no system is flawless, as such this system will be full of holes as any other. However I also believe in the good in people and that one can overcome personal flaws in order to create a workable system from a sheet of rules, as such these rules are subject to dynamic change as needed to suit the growing and changing nature of the room.</p>
<p>On a second note these rules are open and able to be read and evaluated by the community as such we as a cohesive group can change and grow together, I state this because this sheet will also outline how moderators are to treat and handle negative situations which will occur, and I feel while this is outlined by other groups on the server, that the lack of a public file with no feedback option makes for a small and corrupt sect of moderators and users, this is not our goal, our goal is to be as welcoming to the new as we are to the old and not to exclude them from trance, conversation and etc</p>


<div class="ruletext">

<h3>now onward to the actual rules</h3>

<ol>
<li>There will be no personal assault to individuals ,especially to moderation or authority, personal assault is defined as following

<p>attacking a individuals beliefs, bypassing a persons safeties in order to harm/hurt a individual , publicly berating a person by name, without justified reason(this is as per judgment by the Ops on duty) making threats of psychological harm and or bodily harmÃ¢â‚¬Â</p>

<p>if this rule is broken Ops are required to kick the person in warning, if they come back and persist a temporary ban will be put into effect of 15 mins and no longer or shorter in order for the individual to calm down , if they are yet presistant ,then a perma ban will be put in place , until the admin has a chance to evaluate the situation and pass a judgment(if for some reason the admin is to hot headed on the situation then it will be per the judgment of the moderation, and the final call be made by DarkKnight)</P></li>


<li>no hacking, honestly I don't feel even why I should mention this as it is a part of the server rules, hacking is defined as the following

<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“using a proxy to connect to server in order to circumvent, a ban and/or hide ones identity(if for some reason you are a user concerned with your already encrypted yet visible ip and desire extra protection feel free to register for a hostmask) having a unauthorized bot join the room and begin spamming and or attempting to fool system into obtaining OP , this is a violation of the servers ToS and a violation of my personal rules, mocking a ip address range in order to appear to be another more prominent user(this is not only unethical but illegal on a federal level if inside the USA) and any other acts as to be judged per moderation staff and adminÃ¢â‚¬Â
how a moderator should respond to such suspected activity, of course you should report it to the nearest ircop,aside from that, you should play along as if everything is cool, and log the persons activities and send the admin a copy, if you are of the more tech savvy nature, using a ip sniffer and performing a traceroute on the packets would be useful to server admins as well as myself, if the individual begins to break rule 1 bypass the warning and simply ban until further notice , ban the whole ip range as normally proxy services used by hackers have only a few servers on a specific range</p></li>


<li>no gang mentality, This is a Zero tolerance mentality, gang mentality is wrong on many levels as it creates a biased and destructive environment for a group, while I understand some is natural like agreeing on a topic and talking , using it to violate rule 1 by manipulating the (with valid reason) clause is unacceptable, gang mentality is described as the following

<p>A group of individuals mindlessly agreeing upon a group action in the heat of the moment based on the bias of friends,often induced by high emotions caused by trolling, this happens in other rooms ALOT based on personal observation, we strive to be better than that, as such please attempt to keep your heads clear and while having friends think for yourselfÃ¢â‚¬Â</p>

<p>in the case that this rule is violated, if a op feels this is happening they are to remove voice from the troll and send the admin a message on Facebook the following people have access to that DarkKnight,DarkQueen,DarkRook, along with a pastebin to the logs of the occurrence and the admin will have final say, any moderators caught participating will be spoken with and put on Ã¢â‚¬Å“reviewÃ¢â‚¬Â in which the community will then pass judgment as a whole, call it trial by jury if you will..</p></li>


<li>disputes between moderation and trusted members defined as such

<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“should a fight arise in administration , such as a disagreement or argument in the negative nature this is a disputeÃ¢â‚¬Â</p>

<p>in this scenario, the admins are to take it to private chat, and if further discussion is needed , the admin is to be contacted and be made to meditate,final judgment falls within that of admin</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>To wrap this up</h3>

<p>you should respect each other, but I also do not want false emotions or masked hate, the reason there is more to this document or page is that I feel as though there should be a small side section that defines particular situations where consideration should be taken,</p>
<ul>
<li>transgender/genderqueer people, should never have their identities attacked, and should have their pronouns respected, we are not the gender police, nor should we see ever see what is in their pants, as such it should not matter what is there, this is a text based chat for crying out loud, you do not decide someones identity EVER , that is not your place as users or administration</li>

<li>people of lesser economic class IE the poor
<p>don't bash people or invalidate them because of their income nor housing situation do not avoid people who have less than you simply based on your predisposed bias, to bully and or treat those of less income than you, is inhumane and should not be tolerated</p></li>

<li>people who are gay,bi,Les

<p>no one tells you what you should eat, or drink, you should not tell these people either(because I needed a joke after all that seriousness)</p></li>

<li>people with disabilities/the mentally ill

<p>while it is ok to choose your subjects and Tist, it is not ok to discriminate against those with mental illness, they are people just as you or I, many on this server refuse to work with them based on that fact, and I personally believe that is wrong, and as a ethical note you should as well, however if you do not at the least do not treat them differently or as if they are Ã¢â‚¬Å“specialÃ¢â‚¬Â if I see this type of behavior in my Tist or ops I will not hesitate to ban the person , and then precede to chew them out in private message and I encourage the other members of my administration to do the same</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>besides these things</h4>

<p>I understand there are exceptions to be made on a per situation case, in short by the end of the day you can only control you, and I myself, however we have to at least keep it a friendly environment that is all</p>
